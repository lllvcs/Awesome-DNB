# Awesome DNB
A collection of papers and resources about Dynamic Network Biomarkers (DNB) and its related algorithms.

DNB is a novel concept designed to capture the dynamic changes of complex system on the progress of disease transitions. Unlike traditional biomarkers that only measure static levels of molecular activity, DNB can reveal the critical state and the driving networks of diseases before clinical manifestations. DNB and related algorithms have been successfully applied to various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.
